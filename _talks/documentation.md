title: "Pushing Documentation (so it doesn´t hurt anymore)"
speakers: ['markus']
excerpt: "We all love to put technology in place so it works, solves problems and eases somebodies live (or at least their job). But at some point the solutions created will be at risk to cause problems instead of solving them - and happy are those who find some useable documentation to the rescue! What makes good documentation? How much documentation is enough? How can we create useful documentation while we code? How can we integrate documentation into our dev-toolchains? 
Let´s discuss these and more questions and find out how to put a checkmark to `docs` on out project´s bucketlist with a smile!"

We all love to put technology in place so it works, solves problems and eases somebodies live (or at least their job). But at some point the solutions created will be at risk to cause problems instead of solving them - and happy are those who find some useable documentation to the rescue! What makes good documentation? How much documentation is enough? How can we create useful documentation while we code? How can we integrate documentation into our dev-toolchains? 

Let's discuss these and more questions and find out how to put a checkmark to "docs" on out project's bucketlist with a smile.

The talk provides some insight  on our findings and experience on documentation and showcases [Asciidoctor](https://www.asciidoctor.org) and the [docToolchain](https://doctoolchain.org/) including the [arc42 template](https://www.arc42.de/overview/) as a proofed tooling to ease the task to create meaningful documentation.
