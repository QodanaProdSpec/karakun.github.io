BaselOne 2022 conference took place on October 19, 2022 in the Markthalle. As we were quite a few people from Karakun attending, be it as participants, speakers or organizer, we would like to share our impressions in this blog post. Some hard facts first:

## BaselOne 22 in figures
BaselOne is a yearly event organized by the eponymous association existing of [Karakun AG](https://karakun.com), [Bluesky IT-Solutions AG](https://bluesky-it.ch) and [Baloise Insurance](https://baloise.com).

In total, BaselOne 22 offered 26 talks by 29 speaker and 4 workshops to 160 paying attendees. All in all, almost 350 hours of organization time were spent to make it all happen.



## Talks

As said, there were 26 talks, and it was challenging to choose which to attend

## Impressions

As a really handy improvement, a little map to the venue was given to each attendee to make it easier to find the rooms which are located in the Markthalle building but aside from the main hall:

Break time!

One of the very nice features of BaselOne is its size.
It is big enough to attract international speakers and still small enough to easily be able to have a chat with them.
And it is not just the audience which enjoys these direct interaction, also the speakers can be seen chatting and listening intensely.

Very tasty meals from the street-food like stands selling delicious food at Markthalle (included in the conference ticket).

Like the previous years Ursula, from the JUG Switzerland administration, spoiled the participants with homemade Duke shaped cookies.
Unfortunately we were enjoying them so much we forgot to take a picture...
