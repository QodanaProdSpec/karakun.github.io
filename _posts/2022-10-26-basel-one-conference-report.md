BaselOne 2022 conference took place on October 19, 2022 in the Markthalle. As we were quite a few people from Karakun attending, be it as participants, speakers or organizer, we would like to share our impressions in this blog post. Some hard facts first:

## Some figures about BaselOne22 
BaselOne is a yearly event organized by the eponymous association existing of [Karakun AG](https://karakun.com), [Bluesky IT-Solutions AG](https://bluesky-it.ch) and [Baloise Insurance](https://baloise.com).

In total, BaselOne 22 offered 26 talks by 29 speakers and 4 workshops to 160 paying attendees. All in all, almost 400 hours of organization time were spent to make it happen.



## Day 1 - Conference Day

As said, there were 26 talks, and it was challenging to choose which one to attend. 
The lineup was packed with well-known speakers like Ixchel Ruiz, Falk Sippach, Sandra Parsick, Otavio Santana, Katrin Rabow, Gerd Aschemann, Chris Engelbert and many more. 
The talks were nicely distributed across variety of topics and domains of IT. 
It is worth to mention that most of the talks had an introductory flavour to it to attract more beginners, but also to light a spark among more experienced folks.

And of course, there were also talks by Karakun: "Runtime metrics 101" (Markus Schlichting / Stephan Classen) and "Ich bin 3-CPO - wie kann ich Dir helfen?" (Iryna Dohndorf / Christopher Keibel).

### Runtime Metrics 101

As modern applications are no longer monoliths on a server but consist of distributed microservices in the cloud, monitoring becomes more and more important.
 Logging alone won't be enough if you want to be informed about free disk space, a critical number of user sessions or increasing memory consumption. 
 This is where runtime metrics can help.

During their session, Markus and Stephan showed the audience how to implement, visualize and analyze metrics for Java applications. 
They did not only focus on products and ready-made solutions like [Grafana](https://grafana.com) or [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io). 
Furthermore, they also presented different APIs like Java Flight Recorder and [Micrometer](https://micrometer.io) that can be used to extend a Java application with metrics and continuous monitoring.

The slides are available [here](https://dev.karakun.com/assets/talks/Slidedeck_RuntimeMetriken101_BaselOne.pdf). The talk is also available at [Karakun YouTube Channel](https://karakun.com/youtube) or via this [direct link](https://youtu.be/XBtFGwqy7yE). 

### "Ich bin C-3PO, wie kann ich Dir helfen?" - Wie Maschinen nat√ºrliche Sprache verarbeiten 

This talk by Iryna and Christopher was all about *Natural Language Processing (NLP)*. We all use NLP in our daily lifes e.g. when using Siri, Alexa and search engines. But there are far more things to come in the future. 

NLP uses linguistics and machine learning to get a general language comprehension which will be quite similar to human cognitive abilities. In this session, Iryna and Christopher presented the tools and techniques of NLP and discussed the roles of machine learning and artificial neural networks for optimization of NLP. 

The slides are available at the [BaselOne website](https://baselone.ch/dam/baselone2022/assets/Slides2022/BaselOne2022_C-3PO.pdf). The talk is also available at [Karakun YouTube Channel](https://karakun.com/youtube) or via this [direct link](https://youtu.be/Z47sGjK5hXc).

## Impressions

As a really handy improvement, a little map to the venue was given to each attendee to make it easier to find the rooms which are located in the Markthalle building but aside from the main hall:

Break time!

One of the very nice features of BaselOne is its size.
It is big enough to attract international speakers and still small enough to easily be able to have a chat with them.
And it is not just the audience which enjoys these direct interaction, also the speakers can be seen chatting and listening intensely.

Very tasty meals from the street-food like stands selling delicious food at Markthalle (included in the conference ticket).

Like the previous years Ursula, from the JUG Switzerland administration, spoiled the participants with homemade Duke shaped cookies.
Unfortunately we were enjoying them so much we forgot to take a picture...
